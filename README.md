Steps: 
1. Run "FIRST.m" file to include path and compile CUDA program.
2. Run "main.m" file to optimal TIs parameters.
Note:
1. The plot demo functions are in the folder "Photos".
2. The first time optimization for each subject needs more time to prepare input leadfield for GPU.
3. The 'tet' is nearly 10 times expensive than 'tri' element type.
